What are the benefits of a growth mindset?


So today’s blog is on growth mindset. Such a powerful concept which is central to positive psychology. Evidence links growth mindset to a variety of positive outcomes: higher goal achievement, motivation, lower stress, anxiety, depression, better work relationships and higher performance levels.

There is so much science to back it up – Carol Dweck at Stanford University is the person to go to if you want the science and the evidence on the power of growth mindset. And while Dweck’s research is focused mainly on promoting the development of growth mindset in schoolchildren, fabulously, it is also possible to develop a growth mindset later in life, even if you come from a starting place of fixed mindset, as many of us do (including me – more on that later).


 

What is growth mindset? And what is a fixed mindset?
So, before we get on to my tips on developing a growth mindset, I need to explain what I’m talking about. I need first to explain the twin ideas of growth mindset and fixed mindset. So having a fixed mindset means that you generally believe that your abilities and your intelligence are fixed and can’t be changed and that you pretty much have had them since birth.

Having a growth mindset means that you believe that the development of skills and abilities and intelligence can evolve and change through persistence and hard work.

Why does this matter? Well, if you come from a place of fixed mindset, you might avoid challenges because you don’t want to feel embarrassed or humiliated in front of others. This can become an issue because your fear of making mistakes can lead you to avoid challenges and new experiences—experiences which could actually help you grow, develop, and create the life that you want.

Why does this matter – what happens to people with each mindset?
If you have a growth mindset, you are more likely to enjoy challenges, despite the risk, usually because you value learning and growth more than you value any anxieties you may have about others thinking you don’t know what you’re doing.

Because you’re willing to give new things a try, you often don’t know what you’re doing, at least not initially. But you don’t see that as a threat, more as an opportunity to learn and to get good at stuff that you might come to value.

With a growth mindset, you end up with a belief that you can overcome challenge and over time, you build up evidence that proves that point – so it becomes positively self-fulfilling. While following a fixed mindset is also self-fulfilling, but in the opposite direction, because your avoidance of new, potentially embarrassing, situations means that you stick with what you know as a form of self-protection, but you limit your development as a result.

The origins of fixed and growth mindset – taking it way back
By the way, most of us have been programmed to be more fixed mindset than growth mindset partly because the negativity bias primes us to be fearful of potentially threatening experiences.

And partly, because of well-intentioned teachers, parents and caregivers thinking they were being helpful when they told us that we were smart or good at something or naturally talented. When actually that feedback was setting us up to just keep doing the stuff we knew would get us that praise (the stuff we could already do) rather than pushing ourselves by taking risks which might result in failure (and therefore not praise).
